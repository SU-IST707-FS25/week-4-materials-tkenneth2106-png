## Problem Breakdown

### Exercise 2 (10/10 = 100.0%)

**Part ex1-part1** (ex1-part1.code): 4/4 points

_Feedback:_ Good job. You correctly applied t-SNE to MNIST (using a reasonable 2000-sample subset), set sensible parameters, and produced a clear 2D scatter with appropriate coloring and labels. This meets the exercise goal.

**Part ex1-part2** (ex1-part2.code): 3/3 points

_Feedback:_ Good work: you correctly trained a KNN on the t-SNE embeddings, performed a train/test split, and reported accuracy. This directly answers the question about performance. Optionally, you could compare different k values or add cross-validation.

**Part ex1-part3** (ex1-part3.code): 3/3 points

_Feedback:_ Good job: you used UMAP features with a train/test split and KNN (k=3) to compute and print accuracy. This meets the objective. Consider tuning k via cross-validation for potentially better performance.

### Exercise 4 (14/20 = 70.0%)

**Part ex2-part1** (ex2-part1.code): 7/7 points

_Feedback:_ Well done. You applied PCA, trained KNN on transformed data, reported accuracies (1D and 2D), and provided a 2D scatter plot. Alternative choice of fixed components is valid. Optionally, try PCA with explained variance (e.g., PCA(0.9)) to compare.

**Part ex2-part2** (ex2-part2.code): 7/7 points

_Feedback:_ Great job: you applied UMAP to train/test, trained KNN, reported accuracies (including a tuned variant), and visualized the 2D embedding. This fully meets the task. Optional: also plot the alternative embedding for comparison.

**Part ex2-part3** (ex2-part3.answer): 0/6 points

_Feedback:_ Submission contains only placeholder text - no actual student work provided.

### Exercise 1 (20/20 = 100.0%)

**Part pipeline-part1** (pipeline-part1.code): 4/4 points

_Feedback:_ Great job. You correctly applied PCA to 2 components and produced a clear 2D scatter colored by digit class with labels and colorbar. Splitting and transforming the test set wasn’t necessary for this step, but it doesn’t hurt. Full credit.

**Part pipeline-part2** (pipeline-part2.code): 4/4 points

_Feedback:_ Great job. You computed PCA on the training set and plotted the first 40 components’ variance explained, converting to percent. The scree plot meets the requirements. Full credit.

**Part pipeline-part3** (pipeline-part3.code): 4/4 points

_Feedback:_ Correct approach. You use the cumulative sum of the explained variance ratio and argmax to find the smallest number of components reaching 95% variance, consistent with prior work. Clear and sufficient for the task.

**Part pipeline-part4** (pipeline-part4.code): 4/4 points

_Feedback:_ Excellent work. You used n_components_95 from Step 4, applied PCA, reconstructed the image, and visualized the same digit. Approach is correct and consistent with prior work.

**Part pipeline-part5** (pipeline-part5.code): 4/4 points

_Feedback:_ Well done. You trained KNN on original data and PCA-reduced data, correctly preserving 80% variance (n_components=0.80), fit on train and transformed test, and compared accuracies. Dimension prints confirm reduction. Meets the task objectives.
